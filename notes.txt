================== Loan Appliaction (Single form With Multiple entities)==================


install bootstrap cmd : npm install bootstrap
create a 1 manual folder as pages then create 2 components 
    1:ng g c loanApplication
    2: ng g c appliactionList

step 1  Route.ts =  routes we need to create route to navivage and defalut set a page as loanApplication
        purpose : create a default Route (when we open a link the first page will renderd just because of route)
        3 Route has been created (1: blank 2: newApplication 3:appliactionList)


step 3 : 
        app.components.html : router-outlet

step 4 :
        loanApplication.components.html : create your from in this file

step 5 :
        create a 1 folder as model
        then create a 1 manual file : Appliaction.model.ts
        go to api link and see all parameter need to send to api, copy all data
        go to google and search for convert json to TS copy all the code and paste in Appliaction.model.ts file 
        
        purpose : to save  and initile that data in our file so when we write a code it will auto suggest that data 
                export class Appliaction {
                    // here need to page you ts code
                    ex:     
                        FullName : string;
                    constructor(){
                        this.FullName = '';
                    }
                }
                and initile above data in constructor

step 6 :
        loan-Appliaction.components.ts :
            import : Formodule
            we created a 2 class in appliaction.model file 
            as we create a model data we need to use in our loanApplication just import that data


step 7 :
        go to html file and do data bainding [(ngModel)] = appliaction.FullName


step 8 : create button to push data to loan array and display over screen
        button name : addLoan()
        in html file write if else condition
        if (array is empty){
            display No Loan Added Yet
        }
        else{
            run here for loop 
            for (item of appliaction.loans; track $index){
                write here tr td and do data bainding
                <tr>
                    <td>{itrem.bankName}</td>
            }
        }


step 9: on click on Submit need to pass data to api
    go to app.config.ts file : provideHttPClient // import that function in providers array

step 10 : create a service
        make a folder name as service
        then write cmd : ng g s master
        now you created a service with above cmd

        in master service we store api call
        we use depenmdency injection


step 11 :
